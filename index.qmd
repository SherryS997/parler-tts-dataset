## Glossary of Terms

- **PESQ**: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality. A measure of the quality of speech in audio recordings.
- **Pitch**: The perceived frequency of a sound; higher pitches are associated with higher frequencies.
- **Reverberation**: The persistence of sound in an environment after the source has stopped; affects the clarity of speech.
- **SNR**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Measures the ratio of the signal strength to background noise.
- **Speaking Rate**: The speed at which speech is delivered, typically measured in syllables or words per minute.
- **Utterance STD**: Standard Deviation of pitch variation within an utterance, indicating the level of expressiveness.
- **KDE**: Kernel Density Estimate. A non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable.
- **STOI**: Short-Time Objective Intelligibility. Measures speech intelligibility over short time windows.
