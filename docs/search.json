    "text": "Glossary of Terms\n\nPESQ: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality. A measure of the quality of speech in audio recordings.\nPitch: The perceived frequency of a sound; higher pitches are associated with higher frequencies.\nReverberation: The persistence of sound in an environment after the source has stopped; affects the clarity of speech.\nSNR: Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Measures the ratio of the signal strength to background noise.\nSpeaking Rate: The speed at which speech is delivered, typically measured in syllables or words per minute.\nUtterance STD: Standard Deviation of pitch variation within an utterance, indicating the level of expressiveness.\nKDE: Kernel Density Estimate. A non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable.\nSTOI: Short-Time Objective Intelligibility. Measures speech intelligibility over short time windows."
